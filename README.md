# micr0fetch.
A simple system information fetching tool written in go. To request support for a distro open an issue with the 'distro request' label.

# installation.
Go to the [releases](https://github.com/MiraslauKavaliou/micr0fetch/releases) tab and find the one that suits your system. Running the file after giving it exec permission with `chmod +x`

I am working on adding it to the Arch User Repository for ease of use.
